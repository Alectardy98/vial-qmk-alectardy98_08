# IBM xwhatsit Vial targets

All 29 IBM board names have a `universal:vial` target. The 22 new ports copy their corresponding `ibm/<board>/universal` wiring and default base keymaps. Other controller revisions remain in `ibm/`; these images are **only** for the Universal controller variant.

```sh
make xwhatsit/vial/f50/universal:vial
```

Each port includes Vial remapping/macros and the shared live XCAL extension. New ports omit Tap Dance, combos, key overrides and QMK settings to keep AVR flash/EEPROM usage bounded; original mouse/media/solenoid configuration is retained. They use the existing Vial insecure convention. No bootloader image is included.

The link-time EEPROM assertion also reserves at least 100 bytes beyond the keymap for Vial macro storage. Static RAM excludes stack/USB interrupt peaks; successful compilation is not physical acceptance.

## Layout and compatibility notes

- `4978`: FN2 maintenance keys moved directly to FN; transparent intermediate layer removed (2 EEPROM layers).
- `f104`: Empty FN3 consolidated into FN2 (3 EEPROM layers).
- `f107`: Empty FN2/FN3 consolidated; former FN4 maintenance keys are FN2 (3 EEPROM layers).
- `xtant`: Only the original base initializer exists; one remappable layer.
- `beamal_badpinout`, `test` and `test2` retain their original experimental wiring; they are not general-purpose BEAMal replacements.

- The imported `test2` layout had an invalid trailing comma; the Vial copy is valid JSON. Original IBM sources are unchanged.

- New UIDs are unique and deterministic, shared by desktop/browser profiles. Existing seven ports keep their UIDs, layer counts and settings layout. Changing keyboard target or keymap defaults may require EEPROM reset; back up Vial settings before flashing another target.

- All 22 images compiled and passed HEX checksum/address and compiled-XZ-layout verification. No hardware was flashed for this porting task; each newly supported physical board still needs typing, calibration, solenoid/LED and recovery testing.

- Regression tools and firmware-image verification live on Vi_al’s `dev` branch under `util/dev/xwhatsit_firmware/`. Build logs and HEX images are packaged separately on the Desktop.

## Existing-target regression

All 14 original `vial` / `vial_alec` combinations also compile after these ports
(36 successful builds in total). No `vial_alec` keymaps were added for the new
boards. Existing target defaults and dynamic EEPROM layouts are retained.
